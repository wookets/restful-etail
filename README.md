# restful-etail

A trivial example of a RESTful web-service using node.js and express. 

# install 

```
git clone git@github.com:wookets/restful-etail.git .
npm i
```

Make sure you are using the latest node.js. I would recommend using nvm to manager your node versions. 


# usage

## starting the server

```
npm start
# you should get a message that the server was started on PORT 3000
```

## running tests

```
npm test
```

Tests are written using jest testing framework. Mocha is fine too, but jest has nice sandboxing. :)
